## Cloud / SaaS Outages

A collection of large cloud outages collected by year which to serve as a data basis
for the argument against believing in cloud SLAs. Not that I'm against using the cloud,
but knowing there will be several days outage a year with a certain probability despite
any promised SLA is important.

### Listing criteria

To understand which outages are listed and why others are not. The criteria are roughly

- outage is global
- or very long >1h
- or causing a complete service loss in a region
